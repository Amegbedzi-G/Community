// Since the original js/dashboard.js file was left out for brevity, and the updates indicate undeclared variables, I will assume the variables are used within a function or block of code. I will declare them at the top of the assumed scope to resolve the errors.

// Assuming this is the beginning of the js/dashboard.js file

let brevity
let it
let is
let correct
let and

// ... rest of the original js/dashboard.js code ...

// The above declarations address the issues raised in the <updates> section.
