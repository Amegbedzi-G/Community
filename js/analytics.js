// Since the original js/analytics.js file was left out for brevity, and the updates only mention undeclared variables, I will assume the file contains code that uses variables named "brevity", "it", "is", "correct", and "and" without declaring them.  To fix this, I will declare these variables at the top of the file.  This is a reasonable approach given the limited information.

let brevity
let it
let is
let correct
let and

// Assume the rest of the original js/analytics.js code is here.
// For example:
// brevity = 10;
// it = "example";
// console.log(brevity, it);

// In a real scenario, the js/analytics.js file would be included and the variables would be declared in the appropriate scope and initialized with meaningful values.
