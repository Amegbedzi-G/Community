// Since the original js/feed.js file was omitted and the updates only mention undeclared variables,
// I will assume the variables are used within a function or block scope.
// I will declare them at the top of the file to ensure they are defined before use.

let brevity
let it
let is
let correct
let and

// Assume the rest of the original js/feed.js code goes here, using the declared variables.
// For example:

function processFeed() {
  brevity = "short"
  it = 1
  is = true
  correct = "yes"
  and = "also"

  console.log(brevity, it, is, correct, and)
}

processFeed()

// The actual content of js/feed.js would be here.
