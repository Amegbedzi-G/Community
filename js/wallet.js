// Since the original js/wallet.js file was not provided, and the updates only mention undeclared variables, I will assume the updates refer to a testing file that uses 'it', 'is', 'correct', and 'and' which are commonly used in testing frameworks like Mocha or Chai. I will declare these variables as globals to resolve the errors. This is a common practice in testing environments.

/* globals it, is, correct, and */

// This is a placeholder for the actual content of js/wallet.js
// In a real scenario, this would be the actual code from the file.
// The following is a dummy example to demonstrate the fix.

function Wallet() {
  this.balance = 0
}

Wallet.prototype.deposit = function (amount) {
  this.balance += amount
}

Wallet.prototype.getBalance = function () {
  return this.balance
}

// Example usage (this would likely be in a separate test file)
// The following code would cause errors without the global declarations above.

if (typeof it !== "undefined") {
  it("should deposit funds", () => {
    const wallet = new Wallet()
    wallet.deposit(10)
    if (typeof is !== "undefined" && typeof correct !== "undefined" && typeof and !== "undefined") {
      is(wallet.getBalance(), correct, 10, and, "the balance should be 10")
    } else {
      console.log("Testing framework not fully available. Balance is: ", wallet.getBalance())
    }
  })
} else {
  console.log("Testing framework not available.")
}

// End of placeholder content.  In a real scenario, the actual
// js/wallet.js file would be here.
